A software engineer and AI enthusiast currently pursuing my Master's at **University at Buffalo**. I'm deep into building LLM RAG pipelines and scalable web applications. I have a passion for shipping production-grade code and exploring the intersection of distributed systems and Machine Learning.

I'm looking forward to building things that scale to millions of users 🚀.
